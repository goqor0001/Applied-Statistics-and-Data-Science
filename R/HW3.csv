5,1/6/2014,MalmesburyDave,345   Reviews,friends,   areg hotel  ,2014,Saturday,uk,every visit sees improvements i make no excuses for once more offering a review for this charming and non pretentious armenian family run hotel it is not the ritz in london the waldorf in new york it is simply the areg  on arrival the normal warm and smiling greeting from one or other member of the family is the order of the day one feels instantly at home but not before you observe the results of the previous  winters programme of improvements two years ago it was the addition of rooms no 7  8 wonderful comfortable suites this year the rebuild of the lobbyreception yes the areg appears not to stand still yet retains all that is best in small hotels it is clear that it has become and justly so a very popular base for the visiting diaspora it is not unusual to hear a multitude of languages as the guests pass through the hotel to their roomswifi air con exceptional staff typical but filling armenian breakfasts spotlessly clean rooms all justify the tripadvisor certificate that is proudly on show at the reception desk areg is a true 5 star budget hotel that will never disappoint any form of traveller a stopover is a real joy and exceptional value for money,212,unknown
4,1/5/2014,DENXIL,93   Reviews,solo,   areg hotel  ,2014,Saturday,uk,nice suburban location i stayed in room 3 for a few nights last week originally i booked due to its location being right by the main train station and metro the location is super safe as is everywhere in armenia and the staff are friendly and accommodating the hotel is two stops away from the main city square and you buy tokens for 100 dram at the station to get to downtown yerevan simply enter the metro station once you clear the barrier turn left at the top of the escalators and train arriving at the platform will take you central i made a mistake and to the right turn and ended up further in to the burbsnice but not where i was meant to meet friends once again the hotel is in the suburbs but the neighbours are friendly and hello as you pass in the street breakfast was simple but filling value for money,156,unknown

5,1/1/2014,2320885,1 review,friends,   areg hotel  ,2014,Tuesday,usa,areg hotel this is a really nice safe and very cozy hotel which is conveniently located between the train station and republic square either way if one is not ventures enough to walk the cab ride would not cost you more than 2 anywhere in central part of yerevan the folks at the hotel are extremely helpful and carrying they will help you in anyway they can make sure to take advantage of the tours offered by the hotel they are very well organized and managed  in addition to cultural and historical perks armenia seems to be one of the few countries left which does not have dual pricing system they charge the same  tourist or local and the prices are extremely low  by the western standards  sadly still high for the armenians my son myself and even my hard to  please sister very much enjoyed our trip and we will be coming back to stay in areg for sure,160,male
5,1/9/2013,RobertLeunis,32   Reviews,solo,   areg hotel  ,2013,Sunday,belgium,Good hotel in yerevan clean and big rooms where you can find a good nights sleep view from the balcony includes the ararat they organise tours which are a bit expensive but well youre on a holiday breakfast is included be it a little bit plain but they do their utter best the hotel is run by 4 nice ladies wholl help you to get around town the main attraction is the location only a 10 minute walk from the train station so dont take a taxi wholl steal your last georgian laris from the hotel to republic square sets you back 100 dram by metro or 3000 by taxi would i stay here again yes but then again if youve seen armenia once youll never return in your life time anyway,132,unknown

4,1/7/2013,dialtone69,42   Reviews,solo,   areg hotel  ,2013,Tuesday,usa,"yerevan hideaway although this hotel is centrally located and only one metro stop from the city center or about a 20 minute walk it doesnt feel that way its tucked away on a quiet residential street behind the us embassy i was given a huge room with 3 beds even though i paid only the single person rate

beds arent soft so if you cant deal with a firm mattress this isnt your place it is typical in central asia and china for mattresses to be more firm though just keep this in mind

the room was clean almost everything worked air conditioning worked well and this is a wellrun place if a bit faded around the edges the rate reflects that the breakfast wasnt as generous as most armenian breakfasts just some bread butter cheese instant coffee or tea and low quality sausages a bit of a disappointment but hard to complain for the price charged

the lobby is well stocked with beers and refreshments and the pleasant courtyard is a very nice place to enjoy these 

i will try to respond to some of the negative comments other people have posted

 first of all remember where you are this is armenia not london given that the borders with this country are closed except to georgia and iran its almost petty to complain about the size of the hotel shampoos in this country some products are not readily available andalthough this hotel is centrally located and only one metro stop from the city center or about a 20 minute walk it doesnt feel that way its tucked away on a quiet residential street behind the us embassy i was given a huge room with 3 beds even though i paid only the single person ratebeds arent soft so if you cant deal with a firm mattress this isnt your place it is typical in central asia and china for mattresses to be more firm though just keep this in mindthe room was clean almost everything worked air conditioning worked well and this is a wellrun place if a bit faded around the edges the rate reflects that the breakfast wasnt as generous as most armenian breakfasts just some bread butter cheese instant coffee or tea and low quality sausages a bit of a disappointment but hard to complain for the price chargedthe lobby is well stocked with beers and refreshments and the pleasant courtyard is a very nice place to enjoy these i will try to respond to some of the negative comments other people have posted first of all remember where you are this is armenia not london given that the borders with this country are closed except to georgia and iran its almost petty to complain about the size of the hotel shampoos in this country some products are not readily available and you need to understand this and sometimes be glad that something is available at all its also important to consider what is appropriately friendly in a given culture armenians are reserved people they are not gregarious like americans people are not being rude if they maintain a bit of personal space this is just the culture so understanding it before you criticize it is important i didnt have any problems with hot water  on the other hand the hotel was not full and i stayed in the summer not sure whether the problem has been resolved or not but i didnt experience itafter a complimentary review and even feeling obligated to defend this hotel against some of the negative comments why didnt i rate this property excellent i am a very tough reviewer and everything has to be 100 perfect for me to give an excellent rating in my room the holder for the shower nozzle was broken so i had to prop it up on the soap rack in order to take a proper shower also i thought the breakfast could really have been better armenia is famous for very good food so it was a bit of a letdownwould i stay again very good means exactly that and i would not hesitate to stay again",693,unknown

having dinner in the hotel is on the contrary somewhat expensive in comparison to other restaurants around but as an alternative you have an abundant choice of restaurants in direct vicinity of the hotel
the service is good to cordial everybody tries to do his best and most of the times succeeds sometimes it is not the most professional stuff but there is heart in what they do they learn quickly and after having made remarks they never repeat mistakes
the location is as central as it gets but still you are in the backyard of the republican square so even in their nice rooms you have no direct view on the square but a few steps and you are there
a strong point is their breakfast it is more a lunch opportunity with cold and warm food taking time and enjoying the breakfast could mean for you that you have eaten enough until the evening the breakfast room itself is clean but has little charm

anyone who likes an early night should definitely make sure they are given a room on the upper floors as next door to the hotel there is a disco 
on my experience it remains open until about 1am and anyone trying to sleep on the 3rd and 4th floors is likely to have trouble as the bass and sound can be distinctly heard inside the rooms
this is the biggest drawback to an otherwise very pleasant hotel 
its very central just a few steps from republic square and the main post  office from here its easy to walk to most interesting locations in downtown yerevan
the rooms are excellent very spacious and very clean the reception and bar staff spoke good english breakfast is nothing to write home about but not inadequate
the only other niggle was the elevator there is only one for the whole hotel and it isnt  exactly smooth the doors open and close with a bang and the whole process of moving between floors can be quite bumpy in the end we took to taking the stairs on the way down and only risking it on the way up

location is a little odd if you feel nervous about walking around back streets and like the hustle and bustle of busy roads then maybe not your place it is one floor of a multi storey building away from the main roads and it is a bit dark at night but i can assure you its all very safe as anywhere in yerevan seemed to be 
location is perfect 10 minutes from the opera where you will find loads of restaurants and cafés in a city totally geared up for outdoor living this was nice i was there on business but the night life was really pleasant and hotel meg added to it all 
the service is perfect as stated in other reviews my room number 2 was massive but a little noisy as you are close to reception and there are no lobby to cut off the noise the water system makes a lot of noise as well so my first night was not the best but you soon get used to it 
there are only 5 rooms but all seemed very well kitted and the standards are pretty high you would not get anything as good in a regular hotel

regarding the distance to the city center i like to walk around so this was not a particularly big problem for me the trip to the city center is very straightforward but you should probably take a map with you in case you get lost yerevan is a bit shabby looking so you might get a little uneasy until you reach the city center but speaking from experience it is quite safe if you want to take a cab you can ask the hotel or you can just catch a ride 30 m downi stayed here for 3 nights compared to other hotels with similar price tags this hotel is worth the distance specially for those who dont mind a 10 minute cab ride or a 35 minute walk the reception is very helpful a fellow traveler complained about something every day and they rose up to the challenge each time  the lobby has a decent wifi and they have installed an atm which you can use to exchange  or i think other major currencies to dram with rates similar or better than banks the breakfast was good i dont understand why some people on this site complained about it the rooms were clean and comfortable my room had a spectacular view of the mountains the bathroom was nice and modern my only complaint was that apparently the staff dont understand what a do not disturb sign meansregarding the distance to the city center i like to walk around so this was not a particularly big problem for me the trip to the city center is very straightforward but you should probably take a map with you in case you get lost yerevan is a bit shabby looking so you might get a little uneasy until you reach the city center but speaking from experience it is quite safe if you want to take a cab you can ask the hotel or you can just catch a ride 30 m down the road",481,unknown

the hotel looked really nice inside nice design and decor  friendly staff  they also had a big choice of breakfast every morning which was also very good

they also have a restaurant with pizza bbq and some other foods as im not accustomed to armenian food i tried the bbq chicken and it was to say delicious as i tried it somewhere else the same thing and there was no comparison

the hotel also had a cheeky little jacuzzi room with a sauna excellent even had a tv in there

the only thing if i was being critical is that the outside didnt match the expectation inside  example when i pulled up in the taxi from the airport and saw the hotel from the outside i was not expecting itgreat great value for money much cheaper than other hotels and the quality of the rooms is great considering this hotel is only 3 star doesnt look or feel like it at alli came here to visit some friends  found this hotel was cheap as other hotels were not in the city  its a little was out from a centre but you can manage with a 10 minute cab journey as they only cost £1 to get around the city so its no problemthe hotel was very clean and was told refurbished recently and i was booked into one of the new roomsthe hotel looked really nice inside nice design and decor  friendly staff  they also had a big choice of breakfast every morning which was also very goodthey also have a restaurant with pizza bbq and some other foods as im not accustomed to armenian food i tried the bbq chicken and it was to say delicious as i tried it somewhere else the same thing and there was no comparisonthe hotel also had a cheeky little jacuzzi room with a sauna excellent even had a tv in therethe only thing if i was being critical is that the outside didnt match the expectation inside  example when i pulled up in the taxi from the airport and saw the hotel from the outside i was not expecting it to be as good as it actually wasdefinitely coming here on every trip to yerevan spend less get more here in my opinion thank you deluxe ",496,male

 more than one bathroom

cons
 you have to sign a contract on arrival saying you will abide by hostel rules and policy
 you have to leave the hostel everyday between 1pm and 3pm the hottest part of the day due to their cleaning routine 
 they want immediate payment for whole stay upfront
 they charge you to check in early even if they have beds available
 no drinking is allowed
 the whole hostel in no bigger than a two bed unit  rooms have just been divided by partitions
 you have to walk through one dorm to get to another
 beds are small short and uncomfortable
 breakfast is a waste of time one slice of bread and one slice of sausage per person they might as well not bother especially as if you dont get up early it will be gone as no one sticks to this stupid rule of one sandwich each
the kitchen is unequipped for any cooking  you have access to a kettle and microwave it is also tiny

2,1/5/2013,laurakelley,11   Reviews,solo,   villa delenda  ,2013,Friday,usa,does not accept credit cards im writing this review to let travelers know that villa delenda does not accept credit cards  all payment must be made cash only  in the 21st century in armenias capital city this should be noted in flashing red letters for prospective guests  some travelers will not be bothered by this but for those who do not like to carry large amounts of cash for bed and board i hope that this review will be usefulvilla delenda is beautifully decorated but the rooms are extremely small and there are none of the amenities that one expects from a real hotel  also reception is in the basement and one has to walk downstairs into the basement for any sort of service  service is also provided by very young women  possibly teenagers  there is also no reception or service at night and guests are given keys to let themselves in and out of the building   because of all of these factors i think that it should be classified as a bed and breakfast not a proper hotelas to location villa delenda is near a nice park but the area is mixed  older properties that are falling apart along side those that are nicely maintained  i recommend something on or near republic square  that is a better location,219,unknown

4,1/8/2012,bezkomentara,6   Reviews,couple,   penthouse hotel & hostel  ,2012,Saturday,croatia,"mixed feelings about this hostel well i must say i have really mixed feelings about the whole experience in this hostel but the overall it is quite positive its not all the flying colors as other reviews second thing is that we have stayed there for 13 days so many different things happened during that time 

first of all i have booked the wrong dates over hostelbookers and there was no problem with the owners to change the dates back to one the same night  i have booked second we have figured that we will arrive on sunday 5 am in the morning and with bad exchange rates at the airport and the check in was later in the day the exchange and the supermarket are only 10 minutes away on foot and working 24 hours a day so no problem with that weve arrived as expected and weve gotten the coffee and a place to leave our heavy backpacks before the room was ready and weve gotten free coffee and breakfast although it wouldnt be included normally we went for the first early morning walk in yerevan and i must say the first experience with both the town and the hostel was fine 

until weve gotten into the the room well we were tired after spending 18 hours on different airports and flights and the room was stuffy and hot because there was no airconditioning and only small window which was tangled inwell i must say i have really mixed feelings about the whole experience in this hostel but the overall it is quite positive its not all the flying colors as other reviews second thing is that we have stayed there for 13 days so many different things happened during that time first of all i have booked the wrong dates over hostelbookers and there was no problem with the owners to change the dates back to one the same night  i have booked second we have figured that we will arrive on sunday 5 am in the morning and with bad exchange rates at the airport and the check in was later in the day the exchange and the supermarket are only 10 minutes away on foot and working 24 hours a day so no problem with that weve arrived as expected and weve gotten the coffee and a place to leave our heavy backpacks before the room was ready and weve gotten free coffee and breakfast although it wouldnt be included normally we went for the first early morning walk in yerevan and i must say the first experience with both the town and the hostel was fine until weve gotten into the the room well we were tired after spending 18 hours on different airports and flights and the room was stuffy and hot because there was no airconditioning and only small window which was tangled in the curtain so it couldnt be nor opened wider nor closed fixed that in the matter of minutes and gotten the ventilator from the owners for free well the ventilator worked well until we turned it off unplugged it and tried to turn it on the next day gotten the new ventilator from the owner and the same story with the second ventilator later that day okay we thought that we have broken two ventilators but only found out that they shouldnt be unplugged from the socket or otherwise they will need to warm up for 15 minutes or so they could start working again after that they worked just fine but if you left them plugged they would smell funny airconditioning was available only in the common room so part of the time weve spent there rest of the days the room was not that stuffy if you left the window whole day and whole night open common bathroom on the lower level was another funny story there was no normal drain but the opening in the middle of the bathroom where the water ran also the bath wasnt fixed and if you stepped on its edge it would rise and look as if it would topple over but everything was fine until fifth of sixth day when it got clogged and water was running away very slowly we didnt want to complain thinking somebody else will complain but after two or three days nobody complained we decided to tell to the receptionist whats wrong and everything was fixed on the same day also there were no chairs or anything in there only rail to hang your stuff but two days before our departure two plastic pieces of furniture appeared that could double as chairs breakfast was fine on the most of the days also owner was present every day renovating and improving situation ready to give information and help you with everything sometimes even with children present which were most of the time very polite only their dog was sometimes little annoying it would constantly follow you even wanting to enter the room but after 13 days it was the part of the atmosphere weve gotten used to so no complaints about there also all three girls at the reception were ready to answer all questions weve had even after long night spent there when they found out that i spoke a little russian they didnt want to talk to me in english anymore which i am thankful for i almost havent spoken russian since in the end we have had a nice time in yerevan and armenia and although this hostel wasnt as superb as expected by reading the previous reviews it was very comfortable and hospitable place to spend our nights lesson we have learned was that you have only to complain politely if something doesent fit and the girls at the reception and owners family will do their best to fix the situation also i beleive that small quirks we ran into were or will be fixed since and the owner was also talking about expanding their offer with guided daily tours around armenia so i hope they will continue getting better and better ",1021,unknown

5,1/4/2013,GabyCroatia,57   Reviews,couple,   parev doon  ,2013,Friday,croatia,"place to recommend parev doon guesthouse doesnt have many reviews but it should be changed
i think the place is really nice and we felt comfortable there we had our privacy fully and it is such a peaceful place there are couple of rooms on three floors actually and the place has really nice terrace
i think in summer is specially beautiful 
the rooms are really big spacious like a small apartment you have a fridge there the batroom is quite small 
the room and the batroom were clean and it has been cleand on daily basis
i cannot say that the room is beautiful but  it is nice enough for staying and the most important that it is clean
breakfast is included in the price it is an ordinary breakfast
in my opinion the place is a bit pricey but all the places hotels guesthouses in the centre of yerevan are a bit overpriced armenia is not such an expensive county referring to food drinks public transport but accomodation is quite expensive especially in the centre
but the reason i liked  parev doon a lot is the staff
they were so nice helpful that we really felt great there they fulfilled everything we asked for for instance we were supposed to go to a day trip to tatev and we needed breakfast earlier then it is scheduled they prepared breakafst for us without questions 
the airconditionig didnt function and they immediately fixedparev doon guesthouse doesnt have many reviews but it should be changedi think the place is really nice and we felt comfortable there we had our privacy fully and it is such a peaceful place there are couple of rooms on three floors actually and the place has really nice terracei think in summer is specially beautiful the rooms are really big spacious like a small apartment you have a fridge there the batroom is quite small the room and the batroom were clean and it has been cleand on daily basisi cannot say that the room is beautiful but  it is nice enough for staying and the most important that it is cleanbreakfast is included in the price it is an ordinary breakfastin my opinion the place is a bit pricey but all the places hotels guesthouses in the centre of yerevan are a bit overpriced armenia is not such an expensive county referring to food drinks public transport but accomodation is quite expensive especially in the centrebut the reason i liked  parev doon a lot is the staffthey were so nice helpful that we really felt great there they fulfilled everything we asked for for instance we were supposed to go to a day trip to tatev and we needed breakfast earlier then it is scheduled they prepared breakafst for us without questions the airconditionig didnt function and they immediately fixed it and gave us an electric radiator toothey were really at our disposali will just add that the location is also very good 10 minutes to the republic square  which is the centre i definitely recommend it i have a feeling that it is a hidden gem it is nothing luxurious but it has something and we had great time there you can have a beer on the terrace and enjoy",546,unknown

the highlight was the food  certainly unique and they were very willing to cook all vegetarian food for us

we primarily had two hostesses while there  one for the first half of the week another for the second half  nobody seemed to actually live there  they just come through and stay with you for a few days then hand off the house to the next person  the first spoke almost no english or german  the second spoke some english  both were super nice and we liked them but we didnt really have a local source of that much information  so they were able to get us a taxi to town or show us a site that we should go see on the map  but not really provide more detailed information beyond that  we watched one bread making demonstration but there didnt seem to be much else going on

the room we had was nice overall with access to a lovely shared balcony  the bathroom was also shared but we were mercifully the only guests  the bath had almost no water pressure  our bed was perhaps the least comfortable bed ive ever slept on except a sofa bedwe stayed at three jugs for a week during the early summer  based on the glowing reviews we were a little bit underwhelmed  but overall the experience was good  it is just a matter of managing your expectations  the highlight was the food  certainly unique and they were very willing to cook all vegetarian food for uswe primarily had two hostesses while there  one for the first half of the week another for the second half  nobody seemed to actually live there  they just come through and stay with you for a few days then hand off the house to the next person  the first spoke almost no english or german  the second spoke some english  both were super nice and we liked them but we didnt really have a local source of that much information  so they were able to get us a taxi to town or show us a site that we should go see on the map  but not really provide more detailed information beyond that  we watched one bread making demonstration but there didnt seem to be much else going onthe room we had was nice overall with access to a lovely shared balcony  the bathroom was also shared but we were mercifully the only guests  the bath had almost no water pressure  our bed was perhaps the least comfortable bed ive ever slept on except a sofa bed  really lumpy almost like sleeping in a tent on the ground outside  so dont go expecting a hotel room  pretend youll be sleeping in your armenian aunts extra bedroom and youll be less disappointedthe location is okay  taking the taxi to yerivan is inexpensive and worth it if the traffic and crazy drivers dont get you the corrupt police will  unfortunately to get to many sites outside of the city you still have to cross a portion of the city  there is no road that goes around the city at least that does not deteriorate into quite literally a 4x4 trail  i had hoped that by being outside of the city it would make day trips to the various sites easier but this was not the case i still give a very good rating because this is a very good place to stay relative to your other choices in armenia particularly if you eat dinner there  you just need to know what to expect",636,unknown

to start with the positives first  it is easy on your wallet a lot cheaper than the marriott  other good hotels i guess you get what you pay for secondly it is within walking distance of the republic square we were there for yerevans 2795th birthday party and there was a late night party street party on the square  so it was handy to be close by 

however the trouble starts from the moment you enter reception we stayed here 3 times during our trip of 8 days  we had to produce passports  fill in forms all 3 times the rooms are rather large with loads of space but are rather tired  need of tlc the mattress  the pillows are lumpy  definitely need to be changed the bathroom is clean but all attachments like shower  tower rails are made for 6 feet or above people the towel rail came into my hands as i had to hang on to the towel to get it off the rack

breakfast is nothing worth writing about but you cant complain about it either my request for warm milk for the child was flatly refused language issues

the main door is for the republic square but they gave us a room in the 7th floor in the ararat wing this doesn´t means we had a view to the ararat mount no we had a view to the yard in the middle of the other buildings not to the republic square or to the back street but to the space between the buildings during a week 
when we saw the room i went to the reception to ask to change to a room with a view to the republic square but first the receptionist said these rooms were very expensive and show me a big number in amd 
i said this was my problem and i asked to say only the price difference in euros and she took the calculator did some calculations more calculations and she said no rooms avaible

the staff is very nice and also the executive lounge situated on a top floor with balcony overlooking a larger central square

but again this hotel room should be priced 120  135 euro and not more they take double the price of a normal marriott room as there is little competition in the market

3,1/10/2011,THOMASFROMDAMASCUS,726   Reviews,solo,   best western plus congress hotel  ,2011,Monday,syria,"nice location in yerevan before traveling i checked your reviews about the congress hotel i really had my doubts about the reception maid service and overall poor service by the employees

after my three day stay i found all these negative reviews were false

the check in was tops very professional and polite the maid service i had each day was very good and there was no way they were trying to receive a special tip or cause a problem with the rooms minibar every employee from the waiter to the omelet maker were very friendly and gave me the best of service

one night i was too tired to leave my room so i order from the room servicemenutry their pizzas as they are very very good and i had a very fast service

the only downside was that my single room was very very very small it was the smallest room since i first toured europe some 44 years ago as a struggling dental student 

upon my complaint to the front desk they did show me a slightly larger single room without a balcony but my original room had a balcony and that made up for the extremely small size

my room was on the fifth floor 

the morning breakfast was very good especially with the omelet and egg station the only negative with the breakfast was the poor selection of a nice english breakfast tea too many fruity flavored and greenbefore traveling i checked your reviews about the congress hotel i really had my doubts about the reception maid service and overall poor service by the employeesafter my three day stay i found all these negative reviews were falsethe check in was tops very professional and polite the maid service i had each day was very good and there was no way they were trying to receive a special tip or cause a problem with the rooms minibar every employee from the waiter to the omelet maker were very friendly and gave me the best of serviceone night i was too tired to leave my room so i order from the room servicemenutry their pizzas as they are very very good and i had a very fast servicethe only downside was that my single room was very very very small it was the smallest room since i first toured europe some 44 years ago as a struggling dental student upon my complaint to the front desk they did show me a slightly larger single room without a balcony but my original room had a balcony and that made up for the extremely small sizemy room was on the fifth floor the morning breakfast was very good especially with the omelet and egg station the only negative with the breakfast was the poor selection of a nice english breakfast tea too many fruity flavored and green teas being served",481,unknown

and food from there and showed the menu prices and the check to the staff they all gathered up and mumbled something then the lady who handles the checks and booking gruntled and fixed the check i never received the new check but i ended paying the price i was supposed toalso a tip  if you dont like paying the 10 service charge simply pay by creditdebit card the 10 extra is only asked when paying with cash it doesnt really matter for small amounts but after spending hours and hours in the pool with company and eatingdrinking your way through the day the 10 extra will be a quite the hefty sum since the service is slow and your empty bottlesdishes are rarely removed youll feel like you are a burden on the staff who is there to for catering you hotel is rather close to everything youll want to see in yerevan and the two main places to visit have a fixed taxi charge in place simply ask the receptionist to call a taxi for you and expect to pay 600 drams 102 euros for opera house or republic square also when you are in yerevan then dont let the ruthless taxi drivers fool you you rarely have to pay over 800 drams but the taxis without meter will mostly ask for a 1000 drams although the price doesnt matter much 1 euro vs 195 euros its the principle that matters i just dont like feeling like i got ripped off because im from europetrip to the airport will be a fixed price of 2000 drams less than 4 euros receptionist will handle calling a company taxithe breakfast is adequate yet the lack of juices or decent coffee is disgruntling your only option is solublecoffee think

the hotel has inhouse atm if you dont find one and have problems paying the cab driver theres always a security guard and bellhopstaff member outside the hotel so just have them explain the driver that you need to use the atm inside to pay himalso  if you arrive at the hotel and the taxi driver tries to ask for more money suddenly then simply pay what you originally agreed upon and walk out i had this experience after a night out i came back to the hotel at 4 am in the morning and the original 600 drams suddenly turned to 1000 drams taxi driver demanded we pay more but we simply walked out and that was thatin another episode the taxi driver asked for a 1000 drams but i said we know the local prices and said well not pay more than 600 drams which is the local normal tariff i also demanded that the taxi meter to be turned on but the driver said in russian that its not working taxi driver took us to the hotel my partner got out of the taxi while i settled the bill i handed him a 1000 driver started to count the cents slowly and after a while he stopped and just waited for something then the security guard asked him to pull over to the side since he was blocking the drive way i was still inside the taxi driver pulled up to the road side and just watched me from the rearview mirror after 2 minutes of this it was getting absurd yet funny that he didnt say anything you have a client in your taxi who refuses to leave and you wont say anything so i asked whats the problem he replied softly theres no problem i asked for my money back and he said that the price was thousand i said calmlyi said 600 hundred in the start šestsot 600 in russian with a broken grammar and the taxi meter does work after that he just gave me the missing 400 drams i walked out he raced off simply

we stayed there late last year with our family while visiting armenian for a month 
i was bit sceptical in booking such apartmentroom but so glad that we did the service was excellent rooms were clean and really modern actually more modern then some of the 4 and 5 star hotels in europe we stayed at and the price was a lot cheaper then some of the big name hotels in the area that dont even provide half of what this place had to offer
the rooms were spacious and very well set out with modern appliances and facilities bathrooms were clean and everything was new separate kitchen area was handy and provided everything we needed
staff were great always ready to help us with anything we needed they would always go that extra mile to make us feel at home they also spoke pretty good english so communication was never an issue

the hotel location is excellent if you are staying in yerevan over the weekend as its just across the street from the vernissage market  unless you absolutely hate shopping you will be spending at least a couple of hours in this flea market on saturday or sunday  even during week days you dont have to speak armenian to give the taxi driver the hotel address just say vernissage and you are there  the hotel is also a few minutes walk from republic square another mustsee on a yerevan trip

the hotel itself has character the building facade is beautifully lit at night a large chandelier draws your attention in the lobby and the overall feel is open and welcoming

for the rest the place is just not up to the money it asks for a room noting that a standard double room costs almost as much as 50 of the armenian average monthly salary comparing with hotels in the same price category i visited around the globe here is a list of what makes this hotel lag at the low end of its price category
1	rooms too small we had 2 standard double rooms one with twin beds one with queen size bed no space for the 2 pax to move comfortably around the bed nor to store properly the 2 pieces of luggage
2	safe stacked on the bedside table for a brand tufenkian that prides in putting forward armenian heritage and style in the design of its hotels this is rather tasteless
3	wireless wifi is available in all rooms a rather standard feature in hotels of that category in both rooms we had we needed to sit on the floor by the room door to be able to catch the network tufenkians argument was that it is offered so what better not offer a service than one that does not work properly by the way even in small guest houses  in whichlets begin with the positive points front desk staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful and the location is great just walk out of the hotel to visit the famous vernissage weekend marketfor the rest the place is just not up to the money it asks for a room noting that a standard double room costs almost as much as 50 of the armenian average monthly salary comparing with hotels in the same price category i visited around the globe here is a list of what makes this hotel lag at the low end of its price category1	rooms too small we had 2 standard double rooms one with twin beds one with queen size bed no space for the 2 pax to move comfortably around the bed nor to store properly the 2 pieces of luggage2	safe stacked on the bedside table for a brand tufenkian that prides in putting forward armenian heritage and style in the design of its hotels this is rather tasteless3	wireless wifi is available in all rooms a rather standard feature in hotels of that category in both rooms we had we needed to sit on the floor by the room door to be able to catch the network tufenkians argument was that it is offered so what better not offer a service than one that does not work properly by the way even in small guest houses  in which we also stayed in armenia  free wifi was working fine4	inroom minibar the minibar is empty and locked if you want to be able to enjoy the minibar at some point you have no other choice but to order for a minimal amount of 5000 drams not much per se 12 usd but its the first time i hear of a forced minimal charge for use of a minibar not classy at all5	lights in the bathroom are too weak not comfortable for makingup nor for shaving6	curtains at the windows are not opaque enough to darken the room at nightearly morning this is particularly bothersome knowing that streetside facade is flooded with light until 0100 am or so rooms on that side are not comfortable due to excess of light until that time7	beds are very comfortable thats true but too warm for summer season and the ac could not beat the thickness of the comforter either we slept uncovered and eventually got cold or we were too hot under the covers a set of lighter covers for the summer is not too much asked from a hotel of its category8	for a country like armenia where food is cult the breakfast buffet is extremely disappointing and to say the truth quite shameful when comparing once again with comparable hotels9	impossible to open the water in the washroom without having a strident noise waking up everyone in the room and in the neighbouring ones probably also the only solution is to open the water full strength then the noise is gone but because the flow is so strong water is splashing all over i hope tufenkian never paid their plumber10	not enough racks for towels in the bathroom11	no business centre surprising for a hotel proposing conference facilitiesthose comments i shared them with the duty manager on the day i left she listened politely but at the same time she had all the answers ready sometimes even before i had finished my sentence it also seemed that all i said was known stuff to her eventually this gives the impression that little followup action will be given if anytufenkian is asking for honest feedback they advertise the tripadvisor website everywhere and invite to do so so here is my honest feedback to sum up it is asking too much money for what it offers this is a shame i stayed in one of the smaller hotels the one by lake sevan 8 years ago the search for an elegant combination of armenian heritage and modern standards of comfort formed a striking and successful hallmark with this new hotel in yerevan opened less than a year ago there is a lingering and bitter impression that tufenkian lazily surfs on the wave of its now acquired reputation i am severe because i liked the distinct style of their hotels this one in yerevan turns out to be an utter disappointment",964,unknown

4,1/4/2013,John N,32   Reviews,business,   hotel national  ,2013,Sunday,usa,"newest hotel in yerevan i traveled to yerevan armenia on business for about 9 days at the beginning of april 2013  this was my second trip to yerevan  on the first trip i stayed at the marriott  i was booked at the hotel national for the second trip because the marriott was full when i was visiting

the hotel is a small boutique type of hotel which was much smaller then the marriott  i believe there were only about 5060 rooms  the hotel has only been open for about 4 months so the smoky smell that is present in the marriott has not yet taken over the place yet

 the hotel is located right on one of the main streets in yerevan so there is a lot of noise from the traffic horns police loud speakers construction work in the street  it is convienent to walk to most places in the main area of yerevan and about 1 block away from republic square

the rooms are all very nice each one has a different shape and design to it depending on where you are located in the hotel the rooms have a new system in place where the power is turned on in the room by placing your room card in a slot near the door  when you remove the card the power shuts down in about 10 seconds  the only problem i had with this was i tried to charge my ipad onei traveled to yerevan armenia on business for about 9 days at the beginning of april 2013  this was my second trip to yerevan  on the first trip i stayed at the marriott  i was booked at the hotel national for the second trip because the marriott was full when i was visitingthe hotel is a small boutique type of hotel which was much smaller then the marriott  i believe there were only about 5060 rooms  the hotel has only been open for about 4 months so the smoky smell that is present in the marriott has not yet taken over the place yet the hotel is located right on one of the main streets in yerevan so there is a lot of noise from the traffic horns police loud speakers construction work in the street  it is convienent to walk to most places in the main area of yerevan and about 1 block away from republic squarethe rooms are all very nice each one has a different shape and design to it depending on where you are located in the hotel the rooms have a new system in place where the power is turned on in the room by placing your room card in a slot near the door  when you remove the card the power shuts down in about 10 seconds  the only problem i had with this was i tried to charge my ipad one night when i went out to dinner and when i came back it wasnt charged because the power did not remain on  i was later told that any type of card could be placed in th slot to keep the power onthe bathrooms are very nice as well with a heat rack for your towels  there are no tissues in the room and there is no iron in the room either  included with my room price was a breakfast every morning in the restaurant  this was a fantastic spread of food every morning and it was very well maintained by the staff  i was very impressed by the amount and quality of food that was there each morningthe hotel has a pool and and two types of saunas for your use while staying there  the gym was not yet complete when i was there  i used both the pool and sauna and i was the only one there  it was very relaxingthe staff at the hotel was very friendly and always willing to help you  i had no issues at all with anyone and everyone was responsive and pleasant  checkin for me was amazingly fast and easy as was the check out  one of the things the hotel is lacking is a business centeroverall i really liked this hotel    i felt comfortable staying there and i my stay was more enjoyable because as a non smoker there was less cigarette and cigar smoke in the building",727,male

the first time i stayed there it was in a nice private room this room was upstairs and had a nice balcony the balcony was nice but it would be even nicer with a chair and a little table i think all the private rooms are upstairs and i think there are four rooms on this floor these rooms share one shower and one toilet there facilies were always clean and i did never have to wait to take a shower or go to the toilet the only problem with the shower was that the drain was partly blocked so it became like a small swimming pool after some minutes of showering

i had booked my room for single use but it was actually a room with a bunk bed the room was small and basic but clean and bright theres free wifi which was fast when it worked but sometimes it broke down

it has a particularly convenient central location it is kept meticulously clean there are free tea and coffee making facilities and an excellent kitchen should you wish to cook something for yourself the showers are clean and the hot water is hot in the rooms each bed has an individual reading light a small shelf and a cupboard where you can store and lock your belongings and backpack there is also a comfortable lounge quite clearly a lot of thought has been put into the design and running of this hostel it has been modelled to the highest standards that one would commonly find in hostels throughout europe australia new zealand there is free wifi access and a couple of terminals on which you can access the internet for free if you don´t have your own computer i was in yerevan in november 2011 and there were intermittent snowfalls this hostel did not skimp on the heating and the environment inside was always very comfortable and inviting some rooms do not have a window personally this was not an issue 

what particularly sets this hostel apart from other hostels and guesthouses in the caucas region is the knowledgable staff you can actually ask staff about things such as places to visit where to find things how to get to places both within yerevan and in thein the caucas countries envoy hostel is a hostel that has got it right it has a particularly convenient central location it is kept meticulously clean there are free tea and coffee making facilities and an excellent kitchen should you wish to cook something for yourself the showers are clean and the hot water is hot in the rooms each bed has an individual reading light a small shelf and a cupboard where you can store and lock your belongings and backpack there is also a comfortable lounge quite clearly a lot of thought has been put into the design and running of this hostel it has been modelled to the highest standards that one would commonly find in hostels throughout europe australia new zealand there is free wifi access and a couple of terminals on which you can access the internet for free if you don´t have your own computer i was in yerevan in november 2011 and there were intermittent snowfalls this hostel did not skimp on the heating and the environment inside was always very comfortable and inviting some rooms do not have a window personally this was not an issue what particularly sets this hostel apart from other hostels and guesthouses in the caucas region is the knowledgable staff you can actually ask staff about things such as places to visit where to find things how to get to places both within yerevan and in the rest of the country and the staff actually know answers and will willingly assist if they don´t happen to know they will try their best to find out for you this is a concept that is not yet understood in the caucas countries i have been to too many other hostels  guesthouses in the caucas region where the faciities were comfortable but the staff  hosts knew absolutely nothing the government in its wisdom has closed the tourist office in yerevan so this level of service at the envoy hostel is even more valuable there are many things to see around yerevan and envoy also run tours if you wish to take part or are short on time note that there is no hard sell you are absolutely welcome to stay at the hostel and not go on tours  staff will still be helpful and assist you with information to visit places independently all reception staff and tour guides speak excellent english and russian in summary envoy hostel is an excellent establishment and comes highly recommended congratulations to all the staff at the hostel and please keep up the good work",676,unknown

location  arthurs is not in yerevan but approx 50 km away in a foresty mountain area guess someone should get the geography straight so as not to confuse travelers who do not know  and it is a gorgeous location an excellent base for hiking both for seasoned sportsmen and beginners a very pleasant retreat for a long weekend it is apparently not suitable for business travelers and may not be convenient  as a base to explore the country and benefit from yerevan nightlife 

profile arthurs is a pretty resort in a pretty area where you come to relax enjoy delicious mountain air do some hiking if you are up to it and have the right shoes and attire catch up on reading or much wanted sleep  it offers fishing in a nearby pond riding tours and has a good playground for children beyond that not much entertainment is advertised hence not to be expected

do not miss to do some fishing the fishrod rent costs 500 amd abt 1 eur you pay for the fish however 7000 amd1 kg for the type of fish we caught but the fun is you can give it to the restaurant to prepare a great meal for you out of it
the food in general was very tasty everything made of fresh village greens nothing extraordinary but the green place and the fresh food go very well together 
room cost includes breakfast only the rest of the day you can order in the restaurant which has open terrace space you eat and enjoy the nature prices are very much similar to the middleclass restaurants in yerevan however here you pay for quality too

last time stayed in february 2012 was very snowy and cold but in rooms was very hot water in the pool was cold and not pleasant and u have to pay additionally for slippers and bathrobe 
this guest house consists of several buildings and main building in which restaurant small bar conference halls are situated u have to walk a lot and go up and down for breakfast or lunch or a cup of coffee and cant use a car as it has to be parked in parking very bad room service with high prices 
advantage of this property is its locations though its situated far from main road and the narrow and braked road takes 30 minutes so u can get there not earlier than 1 hour 
another one is that there is no other place in armenia like a swiss village and so nice
